  <!-- I am very dissatisfied with this assignment and regret not applying for an extension
        in the end. Recently, my health has been very poor, with recurring fevers and body aches that
        have prevented me from properly completing the assignment. I need to honestly say that this
        assignment has been a failure. Before clearly understanding the assignment requirements, I
        actually chose a video design that I liked a lot. However, after carefully reading the assignment
        requirements, I realized that I initially misunderstood. Then, among many choices, I selected my
        favorite music video for this assignment.

      In terms of colors, I chose similar colors to those in the video for the background to make the
        whole webpage look more harmonious. If I had more time, I would like to add the video to the
        background and blur it, as I feel this would create a better visual effect. For the interactive
        design part, I tried to add functions that I usually enjoy when watching videos, but they all
        seemed to fail. I tried to fix it many times but still couldn't find the problem. I also wanted
        to add sound effects to the buttons to add a bit of surprise, but it did not work as I had hoped.
      
       I am very sorry for my performance in this assignment. I did not anticipate that my illness would
         become so severe, so I did not apply for an extension in advance, which has now led to an irreparable
        situation
