      <p>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>

        <p>The huge "blank" black part that we can draw.</p>

      <p>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</p>
        
        <p>First I tried to draw something in the blank spaces, and I tried to change the brushes. Then I tried to change the color but found out there was only black and white.</p>

      <p>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>

        <p>Drawing with different brushes.</p>

      <p>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>

        <p>Draw random things in the blank spaces, and try different kinds of brushes that made different effects.</p>

      <p>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>

        <p>It is free for everyone to draw anything they want in the blank space.</p>

      <p>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</p>

        <p>They made the webpage look like common computer-aided design software so that visitors will get the idea immediately when seeing the webpage.</p>

      <p>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p>

        <p>I think this will not attract visitors to keep visiting the website because there are a lot of apps that are much easier to approach and use.</p>

      <p>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</p>

        <p>Adding more functions to it and maybe adding a bit task-based tutorial.</p>
