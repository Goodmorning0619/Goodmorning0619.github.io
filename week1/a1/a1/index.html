        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          The huge "blank" black part that we can draw.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          First I tried to draw something in the blank spaces, and I tried to change the brushes. Then I tried to change the color but found out there was only black and white.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          Drawing with different brushes.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        4.  What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          Draw random things in the blank spaces.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          It is free for everyone to draw anything they want in the blank space.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          They made the webpage looks like common computer-aided design software so that visitors will get the idea immediately when seeing the webpage.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          I think this will not attract visitors to keep visiting the website because there are a lot of apps that are much easier to approach and use.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          Adding more functions to it and maybe adding a bit task-based tutorial.

        </sub>

        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          I found the function of this website is familiar to Paint, but black and white version, and have fewer functions. And like Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, SAI, etc. 
        </sub>

        <br><strong>

        10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          The blank part just reminds me of the canvas, and the bar at the left and top reminds me of the tool we usually see in CAD software.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          Feel free to draw anything and be curious about all of the functions they provide so that I can use the software or website more efficiently.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          Creating a new canvas or deleting the things I have drawn on it. There is not a button for me to delete the layer or even create a new layer.

        </sub>

        <br><strong>
        
        13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?

      </strong>

      <br>

        <sub>

          I like it to get rid of all of the colors so that I do not have to think about what color should I use and what color will match it, which kind of simplifies the way using it.
