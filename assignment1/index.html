    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </li>
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed is the character in the middle with a power
        button on it. I clicked on it and got a greeting from the author.
      </p>
      <li>
        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </li>
      <p><ul>
        <li>I clicked on the power button on the character.</li>
        <li>I scrolled left and right with my mouse to check if the fly will move with it.</li>
        <li>I scrolled down the mouse scroll wheel to try to get to the next page.</li>
        <li>I got to the page of his work and clicked on the word "work".</li>
        <li>Seeing the arrow, I scrolled down to get more information.</li>
        <li>After viewing, I clicked on the three lines at the top right which I think should be the menu.</li>
        <li>I clicked on about.</li>
        <li>And scrolled down to see what is in this page.</li>
        <li>After finishing seeing, I clicked on the menu again and clicked back home.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <li>
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </li>
      <p>There is 3 parts I enjoyed the most. The first one must be the fly that moves with my mouse. 
        I like this kind of design and have been finding similar things that I can add to the 
        settings of my mouse. The second thing is how he designed the animation of the menu. 
        The animation reminds me of my cram school teacher pulling down the projection screen to show 
        us some interesting videos or the transition techniques in movies or dramas. Last but not least, 
        the UI design in the about page. I like how he puts the information in the phone, 
        but if it is me, I would like to make the information like messages typed in social media platforms 
        like instagram, messenger, or even Linkedin.</p>
      <li>
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </li>
      <p>Scrolling the mouse scroll. Because the main way to interact with this webpage is by using the 
        mouse scroll wheel to get to the next page, and by left clicking to get more information.</p>
      <li>
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </li>
      <p>This kind of interactive design will work well on both pc and phone. Users can easily get how to interact with the web page and get all of the information.</p>
      <li>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </li>
      <p>	I think the author wants to create a kind of chill vibe when users interact with the web page, and the images and the theme did their work great, especially the fly that moves with the mouse creates a little humour which makes the website more attractive.</p>
      <li>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </li>
      <p>I felt chill and easy from start to finish. The ideas are easy to understand and fun at the same time.</p>
      <li>
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </li>
      <p>I think the chill and ease vibe comes from not only the style of the images but the simple design of interacting, so you will have the same feeling when viewing the web.</p>
      <li>
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </li>
      <p>The whole interaction for the website is like mimicking the way we use electronic devices. At first you can ‘boot up’ by clicking on the power button and it will give you instructions of what to do next. And inside about and work, one is like scrolling down pages on a phone and another is on a laptop or pc. Also, the animation of the menu makes me feel like pulling down the projection screen.</p>
      <li>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </li>
      <p>By using the interacting actions users might know, it makes the website easier for users to understand what they should do naturally.</p>
      <li>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </li>
      <p>This is a wise way to simplify your website and I would like to use it in my further works.</p>
      <li>
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </li>
      <p>I can understand but I find it annoying when he only made the words of about and work interactively but not also the images above, which occupied two thirds of the screen.</p>
      <li>
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </li>
      <p>The animation he designed for the menu. I just really like that kind of design and it goes with the style well.</p>
    </ul>
