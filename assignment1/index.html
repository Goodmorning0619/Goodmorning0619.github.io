    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        The first thing I noticed is the character in the middle with a power
        button on it. I clicked on it and got a greeting from the author.
      </p>

      <li>
        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </li>

      <p><ul>
        <li>I clicked on the power button on the character.</li>
        <li>I scrolled left and right with my mouse to check if the fly will move with it.</li>
        <li>I scrolled down the mouse scroll wheel to try to get to the next page.</li>
        <li>I got to the page of his work and clicked on the word "work".</li>
        <li>Seeing the arrow, I scrolled down to get more information.</li>
        <li>After viewing, I clicked on the three lines at the top right which I think should be the menu.</li>
        <li>I clicked on about.</li>
        <li>And scrolled down to see what is in this page.</li>
        <li>After finishing seeing, I clicked on the menu again and clicked back home.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <li>
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </li>

      <p>There is 3 parts I enjoyed the most. The first one must be the fly that moves with my mouse. 
        I like this kind of design and have been finding similar things that I can add to the 
        settings of my mouse. The second thing is how he designed the animation of the menu. 
        The animation reminds me of my cram school teacher pulling down the projection screen to show 
        us some interesting videos or the transition techniques in movies or dramas. Last but not least, 
        the UI design in the about page. I like how he puts the information in the phone, 
        but if it is me, I would like to make the information like messages typed in social media platforms 
        like instagram, messenger, or even Linkedin.</p>
