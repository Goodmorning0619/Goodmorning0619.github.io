        <h2>
          Question 1: What was the first thing you pay attention to when
          interacting with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first thing I noticed the character in the middle with a power
          button on it. I clicked on it and got a gretting from the author.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of
          each of your discrete actions.
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I clicked on the power button on the character.</li>
          <li>
            I scrolled left and right with my mouse to check if the fly will
            move with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            I scrolled down the mouse scroll wheel to try to get to the next
            page.
          </li>
          <li>I got to the page of his work and clicked on the word "work".</li>
          <li>Seeing the arrow, I scrolled down to get more information.</li>
          <li>
            After veiwing, I clicked on the three lines at the top right which I
            think should be the menu.
          </li>
          <li>I clicked on about.</li>
          <li>And scrolled down to see what is on this page.</li>
          <li>
            After veiwing, I clicked on the menu again and clicked back home.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time
          engaging with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are 3 parts I enjoyed the most. The first one must be the fly
          that moves with my mouse. I like this kind of design and have been
          finding similar plugins that I can add to the settings of my mouse.
          The second thing is how he designed the animation of the menu. The
          animation reminds me of my cram school teacher pulling down the
          projection screen to show us some interesting videos or transition
          techniques in movies or dramas. Last but not least, is the UI design
          on the About page. I like how he puts the infromation in the phone.,
          but if it is me, I would like to make the information like messages
          typed in scoial media platforms like Instagram, messenger, or even
          Linkedin.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 4: What was the most common action in your two minute
          interaction with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scrolling the mouse scroll. The main way to interact with this webpage
          is by using the mouse scroll wheel to get to the next page and also
          getting information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          This kind of interactive design will work well on both PCs and phones.
          Users can easily get how to interact with the web page and get all of
          the information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 6: How does the interactive experience communicate this
          primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think the author wants to create a kind of chill vibe when users
          interact with the web page, and the images and the theme did their
          work great, especially the fly that moves with the mouse creating a
          little humor that makes the website more attractive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 7: What is your impression of how the experience should be
          interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think the author wants users to feel chill and easy from start to
          finish. The ideas are easy to understand and fun at the same time and
          the art style also creates the easy but a little fashion vibe.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it
          should be interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think the chill and ease vibe comes from not only the style of the
          images but also the simple design of interacting, so you will have the
          same feeling when veiwing the website.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
          experience reference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The whole interaction of the website is like mimicking the way we use
          electronic devices. At first, you can "boot up" by clicking on the
          power button and it will give you instructions on what to do next. And
          inside About and Work, one is like scrolling down pages on a phone and
          another is on a laptop or PC. Also, the animation of the menu makes me
          feel like pulling down the projection screen.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 10: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how
          you should act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          By using the interacting actions users might know, it makes the
          website easier for users to understand what they should do naturally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          Question 11: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how
          you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is a wise way to simplify your website and I would like to use
          the same method in my further works.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part frustrating?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I can understand but I find it annoying when he only made the words,
          about and work, interactively but not also the images above, which
          occupied two-thirds of the screen.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>
          What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part satisfying?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The animation he designed for the menu. I like that kind of design and
          it goes well with the style the author wants to create. This is also
          the kind of design I would like to include in my website profolio.
