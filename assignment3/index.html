    <!-- In this assignment, I initially intended to replicate the interactive
    features of the game I chose, maimai, to the official website page of it. I
    think the original website's overall interactive experience is not very
    good. It is not very user-friendly for non-Japanese speaker or new players
    and lack strong connection to the game itself. Therefore, I want to focus on
    improving this aspect. However, after several attempts, I realized it was
    too challenging for me, especially since half of the available time
    coincided with my family trip to New Zealand which was planned few months
    ago. After the discussion on Thursday, I decided to follow the advice and
    choose a simpler solution. Therefore, the interactive actions I selected for
    this assignment are mainly hover and a little click. Although I simplified
    many of the original plans, fortunately, the materials I prepared before
    making the decision were still useful. Based on the game's layout, I chose
    five of my favorite songs as the interactive images. Initially, I wanted to
    create buttons to switch the displayed image in the center, and the others
    will align aside with smaller size, but I quickly realized this was too
    complex for me. Instead, I considered using a slideshow to present an
    animated effect. However, due to time constraints, I ultimately simplified
    it further to a straightforward hover-to-enlarge effect. I referred to
    previous weekly coursework and online tutorials and successfully implemented
    this effect. The mst time-consuming part was the layout design.
    Understanding which code controls which effect was an additional learning
    process in a language I was not familiar with. I spent a lot of time
    clarifying their differences. Although I initially didn't know how to place
    images in specific locations I want it to be, I enjoyed the process of
    fine-tuning the values to find the best fit after learning more. In graphic
    design, which I will say I am better at, I have always enjoyed and spent a
    lot of time on layout design. This project allowed me to find something I
    liked and was good at in an unfamiliar field, giving me more confidence and
    direction in learning to code. After succeeding, I decided to try adding
    some simple JavaScript. Therefore, I changed the buttons that originally
    planning to display detailed song information to play a sound when clicked.
    This recording was a material I had captured in a previous assignment but
    didn't have the chance to use at that time, which proved to be useful now.
    This is the sound of the actual clicking when you play the game, and I think
    it will also help link the website user experience more connect to the
    gaming experience. If I would be able to add all of the other buttons with
    function, I would add this sound to every button. If I had more time, I
    would like to try implementing a slideshow and include more detailed design
    elements. Perhaps I could play the corresponding song when the cursor hovers
    over the song's image or add the originally planned menu bar. I learned a
    lot from this assignment and am grateful for your patient guidance and
    meticulous help, which not only giving me specific and useful advices and
    also helped me avoid the potential disaster of the previous assignment. -->
